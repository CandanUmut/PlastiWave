# PlastiWave

**PlastiWave** is a research project exploring the possibility of breaking down plastic molecules using targeted vibrational resonance — specifically aiming to weaken and disassemble covalent bonds like C-C and C-H within synthetic polymers (e.g., PET, polyethylene) by applying their specific natural frequencies.

Inspired by principles of quantum chemistry, molecular resonance, and vibrational energy transfer, this project maps molecular vibrational modes and simulates potential bond breakage via external energy input (e.g., THz frequencies or harmonic sound).

## Goals

- Identify vibrational frequencies of key bonds in plastic molecules.
- Model energy requirements to destabilize these bonds via resonance.
- Explore experimental possibilities using ultrasound, THz, IR, and sound waves.
- Eventually create a simulation of a resonance-based plastic disassembly chamber.
- Investigate applications for both environmental and biomedical microplastic removal.

## Vision

To shift from *cleanup* to *disassembly*, enabling frequency-based decomposition of plastics — in the body, oceans, or land — through intelligent resonance.

## Project Status

- [ ] Vibrational frequency mapping for common plastic polymers.
- [ ] Energy resonance simulation engine.
- [ ] First theoretical bond breakage model (via simulation).
- [ ] Exploratory documentation on physical experiment feasibility.

## Get Involved

We're looking for:
- Quantum physicists
- Spectroscopy experts
- Computational chemists
- Sound engineers
- Materials scientists
- Crazy dreamers with a purpose
